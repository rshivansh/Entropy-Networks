Radial Basis Function Networks


Worked on improving the performance of Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) by learning its
internal parameters with a new evolutionary method called Jaya Algorithm.

The advantage of Jaya algorithm over other traditional algorithms is that it is bereft of algorithm-
specific parameters.

Additionally, we also included the concept of information sets in our approach which makes a lot
of difference to the architecture as it was now capable of representing the uncertainty in the
input vector.
